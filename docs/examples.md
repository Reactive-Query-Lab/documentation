## Query Model
### Microfrontend usage
In this example, we will use the [Query Model](./query-model.md) to fetch data in a microfrontend based project as a shared model between two microfrontends which one of them is a react and another one is a svelte application.
In this case two developer teams in different projects with different frameworks can use same automated data logics without duplicating the code.

For more detailed information, you can check the [Github Repository](https://github.com/Reactive-Query-Lab/microfront-reactive-query-example).
